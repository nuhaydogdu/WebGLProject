This project is a simple WebGL application that visualizes two different letters on an HTML5 canvas. Additionally, letter colors and positions can be changed interactively by the user.

## Used technologies

- **WebGL**: A web standard for drawing 3D graphics in the browser.
- **HTML5**: Used to render graphics using the Canvas element.
- **JavaScript**: Used to enable the application to run dynamically.

## How to Run

1. Copy this repository to your computer or download it as ZIP.
2. Navigate to your download directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file with a web browser.

## Use

- Color Settings: You can change letter colors with the three color slides on the right side of the page.
- Transformation Settings: You can change the position and size of the letters with the position and scale slides on the right side of the page.

## Learning Outcomes

By working on this project, I gained experience in:

- Introduction to WebGL and 3D graphics programming.
- Using HTML5 Canvas.
- Interactive user interface development with JavaScript.
- Basic information about shader programming.
